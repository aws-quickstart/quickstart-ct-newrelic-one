There is no cost to use this Partner Solution, but you will be billed for any AWS services or resources that this Partner Solution deploys. For more information, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide^].

This Partner Solution requires that you have access to a New Relic account. You can create an account using the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing[New Relic One pricing plan]. Be sure to choose a Standard, Pro, or Enterprise tier for access to administrator features and support. If you don't already have a New Relic account, you can sign up for a perpetually free access to New Relic from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=cea9ae0f-34a2-4b53-aabf-5cf5c2c67938[AWS Marketplace]. The free tier includes 100 GB of data ingest every month, one full access user and unlimited basic users. With your New Relic One pay-as-you-go plan, you only pay for what you use beyond the free tier each month.
