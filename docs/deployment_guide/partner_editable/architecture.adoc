* An account administrator enrolls new or existing AWS accounts in AWS Control Tower, which generates a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/lifecycle-events.html[lifecycle event^].
* The lifecycle event invokes the New Relic StackSet Lambda function via an Amazon EventBridge rule.
* The New Relic StackSet Lambda function invokes the New Relic register Lambda function via Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and provides input for the New Relic StackSet.
* A dead letter queue collects messages that the New Relic register Lambda function fails to process.
* A NerdGraph API key secret is retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager (not shown). The New Relic register Lambda function calls the New Relic NerdGraph mutation endpoint to link your AWS account with your New Relic account.
* A New Relic onboarding Lambda function invokes the stack SNS topic and provides input to the New Relic StackSet, which includes a cross-account IAM role.
* The New Relic stack set creates an IAM cross-account role, an AWS CloudWatch metric stream, a Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream and respective roles to deliver metrics to the New Relic platform.
* The New Relic stack set also creates an Systems Manager - State Manager Association, Event Bridge rule, Event Bridge target API destination and connection associated with New Relic endpoint, an IAM role for Event Bridge to send events to API destination and Event Bridge target DLQ for automatic New Relic Infrastructure Agent installation in ec2 instances.
